What I learned: How to create html elements using javascript and how to display them on a website. Also how different functions work and the importance of properly naming variables.

Struggles: Figuring out how to properly display my elements properly. Didn't name elements properly, so I got confused with what elements needed to be appended.

Improvements: Work on naming conventions and look for different methods which can be helpful.
